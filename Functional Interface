In order to understand the Lambda you have to know about the functional interface.
Functional interface is an interface that contains exactly only one abstract interface.
Functional interface can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method.

Eg:
 interface myFunctionalInterface{
    public void execute();
}

Eg 2:
  interface myFunctionalInterface{
  public void execute();
  public default void print(String text)    //default method
  {
      s.o.p(text);
  }  
  public static void print(String text,PrintWriter writer)    //static method 
  {
    writer.write(text);
  }
}
