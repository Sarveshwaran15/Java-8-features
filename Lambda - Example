Usually, we use the interface by accessing through the class or else with object.
But in lambda function, the name itself indicating that it should be called through function instead of using class or object.
By using the lambda symbol we can indicate that it as a lambda function.
It is used to reduce the @Override boiler code.

Eg:

interface Shape{
    public void draw();
}

public class LambdaExpression 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape rectangle= () -> {
            System.out.println("Rectangle class called");
        };
        rectangle.draw();
        Shape square=()->{
            System.out.println("Square class called");
        };
        square.draw();
        Shape triangle = () ->{
            System.out.println("Triangle class called");
        };
        triangle.draw();
    }   
}
